Maven Plugin for Managing Local OpenCms Development Environment
=======================

For OpenCms developers that use Maven, I have created a local OpenCms environment running Jetty webserver and Derby embedded for its database.  This allows the entire environment to be portable.  This Maven plugin allows for managing this local environment.
